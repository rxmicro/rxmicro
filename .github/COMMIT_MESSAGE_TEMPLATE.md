# Commit Messages

## Usual commit

### The seven rules of a great Git commit message

1. Separate subject from body with a blank line
2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters
3. Capitalize the subject line
4. Do not end the subject line with a period
5. Use the imperative mood in the subject line

   *A properly formed Git commit subject line should always be able to complete the following sentence:*

   `If applied, this commit will <your-subject-line-here>`

6. Wrap the body at 72 characters
7. Use the body to explain what and why (not how!)
