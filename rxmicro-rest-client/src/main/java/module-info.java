 *         {@code io.rxmicro.rest} - is root module package that contains:
 *         <ul>
 *             <li>
 *                 {@code internal} - is sub package with classes for current module use only.

 *             <li>
 *                 {@code local} - is shared sub package, which can be used by other {@code rxmicro} modules only.
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                 {@code detail} - is sub package for generated code by {@code RxMicro Annotation Processor} use preferably.<br>
 *                 <i>Developer must not use classes from this sub package!</i><br>
 *                 <i>(Except documented abilities: HTTP internal types, partial implementations, etc.)</i>
 *             </li>
